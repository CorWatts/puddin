say <<PUDDIN
Slimy gooey
it’s like soft jell-o
like chocolate jell-o,
I can’t describe it,
it’s like a color
Blue is blue
And pudding is pudding
Can you describe it?
It’s like I can’t use words
To describe what it is
A person can’t know
What pudding really is
Without a visual, it’s impossible to describe
The consistency, the taste, only exist in our minds
In our minds, pudding’s a thing,
But I know you can’t describe it
To someone who doesn’t know
Pudding is just jell-o
I can only come up
with similar things
I can tell you what it’s not,
it’s not chicken wings
It’s not tapioca, it’s not a fruit
it’s not liquid and it’s not a boot
It’s like it’s knowledge that exists,
only in reality, but not in abstract
In our minds, we’re limited
PUDDIN
